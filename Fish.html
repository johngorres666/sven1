        <h1>This is Fish</h1>
        <p><h2>Fish are aquatic animals that belong to the paraphyletic group within the animal kingdom. They are characterized by living in water, breathing primarily through gills, and having fins for swimming. Fish are cold-blooded (ectothermic), meaning their body temperature is regulated by their surrounding environment. They can be found in both freshwater and saltwater habitats, from small ponds and rivers to vast oceans.Fish play a crucial role in ecosystems as they help maintain the balance of aquatic environments and serve as a food source for humans and other animals. They vary greatly in size, shape, and behavior, and have been around for more than 500 million years. </h2></p>
