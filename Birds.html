        <h1>This is Birds</h1>
        <p><h2>Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates that belong to the class Aves. They are known for their ability to fly, although some species are flightless. Birds are found worldwide, from tropical rainforests to polar regions, and they exhibit a wide range of sizes, colors, and behaviors.Birds live in diverse habitats all over the world, from the Arctic tundra to tropical rainforests. They play important roles in ecosystems, including pollination, seed dispersal, and pest control. Some common examples of birds are sparrows, eagles, parrots, and owls. They are part of the class Aves and are known for their ability to fly, although not all species can (e.g., penguins and ostriches).</h2></p>
        <p><b>Feathers</b> – which help with flight, temperature regulation, and mating displays.</p>
        <p><b>Beaks</b> – adapted to different feeding habits, from sharp beaks for tearing meat (e.g., eagles) to long beaks for probing flowers (e.g., hummingbirds).</p>
        <p><b>Hollow bones</b> – which make their bodies lighter for flight.</p>
        <p><b>Laying eggs</b> – with hard, calcium-based shells.</p>
