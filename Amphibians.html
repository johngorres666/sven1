        <h1>This is Amphibians</h1>
        <p><h2>Amphibians are cold-blooded vertebrates that belong to the class Amphibia. They are unique because they live both in water and on land at different stages of their life cycle. Most amphibians start their life as aquatic larvae with gills and later undergo metamorphosis to develop lungs and legs for living on land.Amphibians typically have a dual lifestyle, starting as aquatic larvae (like tadpoles) and later undergoing metamorphosis into air-breathing adults. Amphibians play important roles in ecosystems, particularly as predators of insects and as indicators of environmental health, since their permeable skin makes them sensitive to changes in water quality and pollution.

        <p><b>Moist, permeable skin</b> – which allows for respiration and water absorption through their skin.</p>
        <p><b>Lifecycle</b> – they generally begin their life in water, hatching as larvae with gills, and later developing lungs for breathing air as adults.</p>
        <p><b>Ectothermic</b> – meaning they rely on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature.</p>
        <p><b>Egg-laying in water</b> – most species lay soft, gelatinous eggs in water or moist environments to keep them from drying out.</p>
