        <h1>This is Mammals</h1>
        <p><h2>Mammals are a class of animals within the Animalia kingdom that are distinguished by several unique characteristics. They are warm-blooded vertebrates, meaning they have a backbone and can regulate their body temperature independently of the environment. Mammals are highly diverse and can be found in almost every habitat on Earth, from oceans to deserts.

        <p><b>Mammary glands:</b> Female mammals have specialized glands that produce milk to nourish their young.</p>

        <p><b>Hair or fur:</b> All mammals have some form of hair or fur, even if it's just during certain life stages. This helps with insulation and protection.</p>

        <p><b>Warm-blooded (endothermic):</b> Mammals regulate their internal body temperature regardless of external conditions.</p>

        <p><b>Live birth:</b> Most mammals give birth to live young (except for monotremes like the platypus and echidna, which lay eggs).
            Four-chambered heart: Mammals have a highly efficient circulatory system with a heart divided into four chambers.</p>

        <p><b>Complex brains:</b> Mammals typically have larger and more complex brains relative to their body size, which allows for advanced behaviors, problem-solving, and social interactions.</p>
